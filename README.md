Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns.

The dataset used in this project was developed from a record of more than 260k gun violence incidents, with detailed information about each incidents. The primary aim of this dataset was that it would be easier for data scientists and statisticians to study gun violence and make informed predictions about future trends. The CSV file contains data for all recorded gun violence incidents in the US between January 2013 and March 2018, inclusive.
